# This is what happend inside the `Active` Period
The access review part of a certification is when someone who is an authority of some sort – such as a people manager, or someone responsible for an application like a Human Resources system or a financial database – reviews the access that other users have, to verify whether or not it is correct and appropriate, and to make any necessary corrections to revoke inappropriate access.

## Passing Review to another
### Deligating Reviews
When you delegate a review item to someone else, you are allowing that person make the decisions and return the item to you, so that you can review it, accept or change their decision, and then sign off. With delegation, the original reviewer still retains ultimate control of the decision and the sign-off.

### Reassigning Reviews
Reassigning is different from delegating, in that reassigned items are no longer the responsibility of the original reviewer. The person the items are reassigned to assumes complete responsibility for all decisions on those items, and must sign off on those decisions themselves. However, the original owner of the overall access review (that is, the person doing the reassigning) typically still retains responsibility for making sure the person the items were reassigned to completed the review.

### Forwarding Reviews
Forwarding a review means you relinquish all responsibility for the access review. You can not retract it, or even see what activity has occurred in the review – you pass all responsibility to the new owner, including the ability to change any decisions you may have already made.

### Undoing Delegation and Reassignment of Reviews
Forwarded items cannot be recalled. Once you forward something, you no longer have access to it, and cannot recall it or edit it in any way.

### Signing Off no Reviews
When decisions have been made for everything in your review, you can sign off on the review. Sign-off cannot occur until all items in certification have been decided, including any delegated or reassigned items, unless the certification was specifically configured to allow it. Also, if a challenge period is enabled, sign off cannot occur until that period is complete.
