# What is Role
Roles are essentially collections of permissions. Through roles, system entitlements can be grouped together and presented as a logical unit, such as a job function, rather than as a detailed and often difficult-to-interpret list of access rights

Within IdentityIQ, users are granted permissions through the roles that are assigned to them, or through roles they inherit through a role hierarchy.
